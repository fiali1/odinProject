# Odin Project

### Curriculum provided by The Odin Project, divided in courses that focus on fullstack Ruby on Rails development.

The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online.
Since itâ€™s inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted countless others learn enough programming to work on their own personal projects.

Founded in 2013 by Erik Trautman, The Odin Project is now sponsored by [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/?utm_source=odin&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=odin-about), a new type of technology school that provides 1-on-1 learning through its network of industry experts, hiring partners, and online platform to deliver a structured and flexible education. The Odin Project is maintained and continually improved by a team of volunteers, many of whom learned to code with us.
